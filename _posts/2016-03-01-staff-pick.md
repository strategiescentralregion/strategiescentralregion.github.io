If you are as excited as we are for the upcoming Trauma convening in May, there is something you can read to pass the time in the months leading up to it. Our keynote speaker Elaine Miller-Karas wrote a capitvating book, [<u><strong>Building Resilience to Trauma: The Trauma and Community Resiliency Models</strong></u>][1]. The book serves as a step-by-step guide for clinicians to use when helping clients that have been exposed to trauma.

A few significant take-home points from her book include:

* Use of the Trauma Resiliency Model (TRM), a series of nine skills given to clients to reduce and prevent symptoms of traumatic stress, and may help to stabilize the nervous system. The first six of the skills are called the Community Resiliency Model (CRM) and are referred to as the "wellness skills". The wellness skills serve to assist the client to monitor their own sensations and decipher the difference between feelings of distress and feelings of well-being. The next three skills relate to helping clients to reprocess their traumatic experiences.
* Truly understanding and teaching the client about the nervous system and how the brain reacts when dealing with traumatic events.
* Guiding clients to the "resilient zone", which is a way for them to reassess daily stressors and react appropriately.
* Age appropriate techniques to help traumatized children develop TRM/CRM skills.
